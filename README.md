# Power BI Data Professionals Dashboard

## Overview 
Using Power BI, a dashboard was built using survey data from data professionals. The dashboard provides insights on career paths and job satisfaction, salary statistics, and demographics. A significant portion of the project was completed following Alex the Analyst's SQL tutorial on Youtube; a second dashboard was built independently afterwards. 

## Key Features 
  - Salary, Current Role, Industry, Country Aspect Happiness, Other Demographics 

## Skills and Tools Used
- Power BI: Dashboard creation and interactive data visualization
- Data Transformation: Using Power Query for data cleaning
- DAX: Creating custom metrics for enhanced analysis
- Data Analysis: Using real-world survery data to extract insights on the data field
